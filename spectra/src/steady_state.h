 * \f$ \int W(\omega) \chi_i(\omega) d\omega \f$
 * where \f$ \chi_i(\omega) \f$ is the absorption spectrum of the i'th
 * exciton and \f$ W(\omega) \f$ is the incident light.

 * If the pulse is not `FLAT` then we need to know where its centre is:
 * for `DELTA` this is enough but for `LORENTZIAN` or `GAUSSIAN` we
 * also need the width. We do not need the peak height because I
 * normalise the integral to 1, as will be explained in the 
 * documentation for incident().
 *
 * For `LORENTZIAN` we have the form
 * \f[
      \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma} 
      \frac{\gamma^2}{(x - x_0)^2 + \gamma^2}
 * \f]
 * where `centre` \f$ = x_0 \f$ and `width` \f$ = \gamma \f$.
 *
 * For `GAUSSIAN` we have
 * \f[
      \mathcal{N} = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} 
      \exp{-\frac{1}{2} {(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})}^2}
 * \f]
 * where `centre` \f$ = \mu \f$ and `width` \f$ = \sigma \f$.
 *
 * `centre` and `width` should be given in \f$ cm^{-1} \f$.
