/** Determines initial conditions for steady-state solver.
 *
 * For steady state fluorescence we need to solve a coupled set of
 * equations - I use GSL root finding for this. Obviously in order
 * for this to work we need to specify initial conditions - this enum
 * switches between them. options are `BOLTZ` for straight Boltzmann
 * factors of the different exciton states, 
 * `BOLTZ_MUSQ` for Boltzmann factors weighted by the excitons'
 * oscillator strength \f$ {|\mu|}^2 \f$, `FLAT` for all the
 * probabilities equal, `MAX` for only the exciton state with the
 * highest oscillator strength being excited.
 *
 * All of these have the normalisation 
 * \f$ \sum_{i = 1}^N P_i(0) = 1 \f$
 * as expected.
